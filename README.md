# Tokyo 2021 Olympics Data Processing Project

## Introduction

This project revolves around the comprehensive processing and analysis of the data from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, encompassing athlete records, coaching staff, medal standings, teams, and athlete gender distribution by sport. Leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft Azure, we orchestrated the collection, storage, processing, and visualization of this dataset, showcasing the potential of cloud computing in handling large-scale data analytics tasks.

## Features

- **Data Collection:** Utilized Microsoft Azure services, specifically Azure Data Factory, to seamlessly collect raw data from diverse sources associated with the Tokyo 2021 Olympics.

- **Data Storage:** Employed Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to store the raw data efficiently, ensuring accessibility and scalability for cloud-based data processing.

- **Cloud Setup:** Configured Azure resources, including creating a container and establishing the necessary configurations, to facilitate a cloud-based computing environment.

- **Data Processing and Transformation:** Leveraged Azure Databricks for efficient data processing, transformation, and preliminary visualization tasks. This involved cleaning, structuring, and enhancing the raw data for meaningful analysis.

- **Data Lake Integration:** Uploaded the transformed data back to Azure Data Lake Gen2, providing a structured repository for further use.

- **Azure Synapse Analytics Integration:** Utilized Azure Synapse Analytics to create a dedicated database, with each transformed file serving as an individual table. This streamlined data management and enhanced query performance.

- **Advanced Data Visualization:** Leveraged the capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics to construct complex queries for additional visualizations, offering deeper insights into the Tokyo 2021 Olympics data.
